# About the Project

`temp_tunes` is a simple project with one endpoint:

`api/v1/temptunes/suggestions/city/<str:city>/`

This endpoint returns the temperature of a specified city and a playlist based on the climate. For example:

```bash
curl localhost/api/v1/temptunes/suggestions/city/marica/
```

Response 200:

```json
{
    "city": "Maric√°",
    "temperature": 19.95,
    "playlist": [
        {
            "track_name": "Hotel California - Live On MTV, 1994",
            "track_size": 432040
        },
        {
            "track_name": "Smells Like Teen Spirit",
            "track_size": 301453
        }
    ]
}
```

# Project Structure

The project uses Docker with Docker Compose for local development and deployment, with Nginx as the HTTP server.

It integrates with two APIs:
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

This is a toy project and has several issues that need to be addressed to make it production-ready:

1. **High Latency on Endpoint**:
   - This occurs because there is no cache control based on the city or playlist.
   - A solution could be to store the Spotify API results and collected city data in a database with a cache policy, such as one hour.

2. **Low Flexibility in Recommendations**:
   - Currently, updating policies requires deployment. By storing playlist identification rules by temperature in the database, recommendations can be changed by simply updating the database.

3. **No Authentication Policies**:
   - The project lacks authentication mechanisms.

4. **Low Observability**:
   - There are no logs or integrations with observability tools like Kibana, Sentry, or New Relic.

The project uses a flexible pattern with use cases, meaning the implementation of inputting a city and getting a list of songs and climate data is decoupled from the HTTP protocol. This makes it easy to implement additional features, such as a notification system that sends recommendations via email, using the same use case.

## Project Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill it with the correct values, paying attention to:
- `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can obtain these keys from the links provided in the project structure section.

Build requirements:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Run `make up`

Access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to test your environment.

## Tests

With the application running:

Run `make test`
